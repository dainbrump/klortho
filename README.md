## :dart: About

Klortho is named after the "keymaster" character from the original Ghostbusters movie. It started as, and currently is, part experiment and part necessary tool. I spelled it with a "K" to 1) avoid copyright/trademark drama; and 2) I'm a KDE user and we always name things starting with "K". (I use Arch, btw)

There are many tutorials and other tools to assist users with managing ssh server configurations and client configurations. I've used them all and like them just fine. In my previous job and in my personal life, I manage a lot more servers, EC2 instances, Raspberry Pis, etc than I probably should. As a result, my `.ssh` directory gets quite messy and sometimes out of date. Then it becomes an ordeal to clean up settings and make sure everything still works. While I have no problems using a command line editor to make the changes, I've gotten kind of lazy about such maintenance tasks in my old-age and prefer a simple GUI for things like this. Plus, I've spent the past 20+ years working in web application development and wanted to try my hand at something a little bit different. Thus, Klortho was born.

The goals for Klortho are:

- Provide a simple UI for managing the configuration of my ssh client connections.
- Provide a simple UI for managing sshd server configurations that can be saved and copied to machines as needed.
- Provide a simple UI for "organizing" all of my public/private keys that I need for ssh to work.

## :sparkles: Features

There are no currently finished / usable features at the moment. Klortho is very much a work in progress.

<!-- :heavy_check_mark: Feature 1;\ -->
<!-- :heavy_check_mark: Feature 2;\ -->
<!-- :heavy_check_mark: Feature 3; -->

## :rocket: Technologies

The following tools were used to build Klortho:

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## :white_check_mark: Requirements

Make sure you have at least Bun and Rust installed. The rest _should_ install itself.

## :checkered_flag: Starting

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/dainbrump/klortho

# Access
$ cd klortho

# Install Javascript/Typescript stuffs
$ bun install
